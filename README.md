# goguid
goguid library is a UUID generator for golang.

## Install
Goguid is simple to install.


        go get github.com/chrisftw/goguid

## Documentation
Goguid is simple to use.


        import ( "chrisftw/goguid" )
        
        myUuid := goguid.GenV4()

## Notes
This is a simple and quick UUID generator I created.  Currently it only generates random UUID Version 4 strings, as that is all I required.

If you need some other UUID version generated, it could be added easily.
